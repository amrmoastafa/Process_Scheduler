# Process Scheduluer 
This is a desktop application that is a simulation for the operating system's process scheduler. This project is an assignment coursework for an Operating System's course. 
With an interactive GUI, our process scheduler can compute the following processes:
- [ ] FCFS
- [ ] SJF (Preemptive and Non Preemptive)
- [ ] Priority (Preemptive and Non Preemptive) (the smaller the priority number the
higher the priority)
- [ ] Round Robin

## Inputs and Outputs

#### Inputs
The inputs to the processes scheduler are: 
- [ ] Type of scheduler
- [ ] No. of Processes
- [ ] Required information about each process
according to the scheduler type.

#### Outputs
The outputs of the program is required information about each process
according to the scheduler type.
